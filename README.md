We are interested in looking at the impact of home-court advantage on team performance in NCAA college basketball. We will be primarily focusing on at least one conference (Big Ten) over a time period of at least three years. The data will come from each specific team’s websites. For example: https://ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/mens-basketball/stats/2023-24. We could also work with attendance data and see whether that has any significant impact as well.


Some specific questions of interest are: how do we quantify home court advantage in NCAA basketball? Does this home court advantage differ for different teams, or the same team during different years? What specific stats do home court advantage impact? Can we group different home courts depending on how home court advantage impacts different teams differently?


We have found a variety of research articles related to our questions, including:

Unlike our analysis, these studies do not go into exploring how different team’s home court advantage may vary. In terms of appropriate analysis, we will likely start with multiple regression. We may also consider doing logistic regression to build models that would predict the home team’s likelihood of winning. For our machine learning technique, we are planning on exploring K-means clustering, in order to group different college’s home court advantages.
